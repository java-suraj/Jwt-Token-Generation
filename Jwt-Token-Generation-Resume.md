# Jwt-Token-Generation

## Overview
**Jwt-Token-Generation** is a Java-based project that demonstrates secure JWT (JSON Web Token) creation and management for authentication and authorization in applications. The repository showcases best practices in token generation, validation, and handling using modern Java frameworks.

## Key Features
- **JWT Generation:** Securely creates signed JWT tokens for user authentication.
- **Token Validation:** Implements robust validation mechanisms to verify token integrity and expiration.
- **Modular Design:** Clean separation of concerns for easier extensibility and maintenance.
- **Sample API Integration:** Example endpoints showing token usage in API authentication.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- [List any frameworks/libraries used, e.g., Spring Boot, jjwt, etc.]
- Maven/Gradle (specify which one)
- [Add other relevant technologies, e.g., REST API, JUnit, etc.]

## Role & Contributions
- Designed and implemented secure JWT generation and validation logic.
- Developed modular and scalable authentication components.
- Wrote comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure reliability.
- Documented code and usage for maintainability and onboarding.
